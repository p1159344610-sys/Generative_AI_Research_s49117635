# AI_Research

This repository contains all work pertaining to the Generative Artificial Intelligence Research project, including data drafts, experimental planning, research interviews, and the final submission. 
The data_draft folder houses preliminary datasets, questionnaire drafts, and proposal drafts; the experimental_planning folder contains images and materials used during the experimental design phase; 
the research_interview folder preserves interview transcripts for analysis; and the final_submit folder holds the completed paper, proposal, and references. 
The file structure is clearly organised to facilitate rapid access to raw data, supporting materials, and final deliverables. Collaborators should create separate branches when making modifications, use clear commit messages, and adhere to file naming conventions to prevent confusion.
Access restrictions must be applied to sensitive materials such as interview transcripts and questionnaire data to protect participant privacy, whilst ordinary drafts, datasets, and scripts may be shared freely. 
This structure ensures efficient storage, convenient navigation, and provides secure safeguards for future collaboration.
